## üéØ AI Prompts for Filtering & Sorting

Here are proven prompts you can use with any AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):

### üîç **Basic Filtering**
```
I have a browser history JSON file with 10,325 URLs. Please analyze the attached file and:

1. Filter URLs related to [YOUR INTEREST] (e.g., "machine learning", "web development", "design")
2. Remove duplicate or similar URLs
3. Sort by relevance and recency
4. Return the top 50 most valuable resources

Focus on educational content, tutorials, documentation, and high-quality resources.
```

### üìö **Learning Resource Extraction**
```
From this browser history file, extract all learning resources and organize them by:

1. **Programming & Development** (tutorials, documentation, courses)
2. **Career & Professional** (LinkedIn articles, job resources, networking)
3. **Tools & Productivity** (useful software, apps, productivity hacks)
4. **Industry News** (tech news, updates, trends)

For each category, provide:
- URL and title
- Why it's valuable
- Suggested priority (High/Medium/Low)
```

### üéØ **Project-Specific Filtering**
```
I'm working on a [PROJECT TYPE] project. From my browser history:

1. Find URLs related to [SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES/TOPICS]
2. Identify the most visited and recently accessed resources
3. Group by relevance to my project
4. Highlight any resources I might have forgotten about
5. Suggest a reading/study order

Remove social media, entertainment, and unrelated content.
```

### üßπ **Cleanup & Organization**
```
Help me clean up my browser history by:

1. Identifying duplicate or very similar URLs
2. Finding broken or outdated links (based on title/domain patterns)
3. Categorizing URLs into:
   - Keep (valuable, frequently used)
   - Archive (useful but not current)
   - Delete (outdated, low value)
4. Creating a prioritized bookmark structure

Provide reasoning for each categorization.
```

### üìä **Pattern Analysis**
```
Analyze my browsing patterns from this history file:

1. What are my main interests based on domains and categories?
2. What learning paths can you identify?
3. Which resources did I visit multiple times? (high visit_count)
4. What gaps in my knowledge can you identify?
5. Suggest complementary resources I might be missing

Focus on professional development and learning opportunities.
```

## üí° Pro Tips for AI Interaction

### ‚úÖ **Do This:**
- Upload the JSON file for complete analysis
- Use the CSV file for quick manual checks
- Be specific about your goals/interests
- Ask for explanations of filtering decisions
- Request export formats (JSON, CSV, markdown lists)

### ‚ùå **Avoid This:**
- Don't upload the entire 10MB file to basic chatbots (use the CSV instead)
- Don't ask for everything at once - focus on specific needs
- Don't ignore the category classifications already done

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details for Advanced Users**

### JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "total_entries": 10325,
